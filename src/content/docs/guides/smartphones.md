descripton: Your smart phone is making you unhappy. Use it less.

It is no secret that your phone is making you unhappy. At least, I have yet to read a study that marries increased screen time with increased happiness. Yet, plop oneself down in any public space, and you will inevitably witness a deluge of glass-eyed phone scrollers. Hell, one of them might even be you!

How did we get to a place where a couple goes out to dinner—presumably to spend more time with each other—only to surf TikTok independently? In perhaps the most hilarious and tragic example of distracted phone usage, I once watched a man try to Instagram the concert he was attending, forget who it was, check the ticket stub in Gmail, scroll around on Wikipedia to learn more about the artist, and then field a bunch of text messages about golf. All to the background of a song that was not so subtly about the toxicity of cell phone indulgence. I am not immune to it either. I still sometimes catch myself furiously refreshing my favorite news feeds as if there is some achievement one unlocks by seeing a new article first.

First!

Or worse: I find myself staring at a digital shopping cart full to the brim with items of varying usefulness.

As an extreme introvert, my smartphone was something of a godsend in my bachelor days. It meant I could go somewhere alone and appear as though somebody cared about me. Of course, we all knew I was tapping refresh on Facebook and not, in fact, answering an onslaught of messages from my entourage. Furthermore, I was deluded to think that gluing my eyes to a screen made me look and feel anything other than more lonely.

I eventually learned to get over my fear of public displays of singularity and instead traveled with a book as my prop and companion. I try to make a concerted effort not to pull out my phone when I have downtime. It is often tempting to sneak a peek here and there. But there is almost invariably nothing there for me. Therein lies the whole issue with smartphones. They were not designed for us. Once you accept that their utility is a byproduct of the data-collecting ad revenue machine they are meant to be, you can start to have a healthy relationship with it.

The smartphone was billed as the Swiss Army knife of technology. You no longer needed a GPS, Walkman, Game Boy, or day planner if you simply signed the terms of agreement and willingly handed over your life to a single slab of glowing, touch-sensitive glass. It is true that the smartphone gave us those things, but at what sacrifices?

This is why, perhaps counterintuitively, many of my suggestions will involve acquiring more technology. Think about what essential features your phone provides and ask yourself if a purpose-built device could provide a better, distraction-free experience.

My gateway into this line of thinking was the smartwatch. I often need to two-factor authenticate applications for work, which typically involves unlocking and engaging with my phone for a brief moment. Once eyes are trained on the screen, all bets are off. What starts as a simple login ends halfway down a NY Times article. A smartwatch gives you freedom from the smartphone rabbit hole by letting you engage with notifications without access to the whole suite of attention-stealing apps. The key to making this work is to be ruthless about which notifications you allow through. Uninstall anything that you do not regularly use. Mute notifications on the apps you want to keep but don't want to hear from. If you aren't ready to kill your social media accounts, at least mute them. I've even gone as far as creating a new phone number and email address that is only ever shared with REAL people that I care about and would want to respond to immediately. This way, I can turn off notifications from the junk and let bots quietly churn in silence. If you've already burned your current number by sticking it in one too many sketchy web forms, just port it over to Google Voice and start fresh with your carrier. Ideally, your watch should only notify you about things you really care about. No time wasters allowed!

Once you have achieved notification bliss, I urge you to experiment with leaving your phone on your nightstand (or wherever it rests) any time you are home. If my own experience is any indication, you won't always succeed in this experiment. So ask yourself... What is it you regularly need your phone for? Can you get this some other way? For me it was music, so I bought myself a walkman, Yes they still exist, Do you play games on your phone? Try a dedicated gaming handheld. Read the news? Get a magazine subscription...

You may not immediately feel happier with less screen time. You might even feel _bored_,

Sit with that feeling.

Revel in it.

What does your mind do?

What do you notice?

What will you do now that you've reclaim time for yourself from your device?
